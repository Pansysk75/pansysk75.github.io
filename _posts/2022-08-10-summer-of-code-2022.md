This post is about my contribution to the HPX Concurrency and Parallelism library, for GSoC 2022. 

# Overview

This summer, I joined Ste\|\|ar group as a contributor through [Google Summer of Code (GSoC)][GSOC]. I contributed to the [HPX project][HPX], which is a C++ Standard Library for Concurrency and Parallelism.

My project? **HPX Algorithm Performance Analysis & Optimization**


>To explain further:
>
>The C++ standard library defines functions for commonly used algorithms (eg. sorting, searching).
>HPX provides sequential and parallel implementations for all these algorithms.
>
>My GSoC project involved performance analysis and optimizations for these implementations.



# Goals

Text text 'text' text

More text lots of text, big body of text text and some more text, text. Wow that's not a lot of texty text.

```ruby
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
```
