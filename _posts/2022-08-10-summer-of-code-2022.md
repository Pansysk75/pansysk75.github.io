This post is about my contribution to the HPX Concurrency and Parallelism library, for GSoC 2022. 

# Overview

This summer, I joined Ste\|\|ar group as a contributor through [Google Summer of Code (GSoC)][GSOC]. I contributed to the [HPX project][HPX], which is a C++ Standard Library for Concurrency and Parallelism.

My project? **HPX Algorithm Performance Analysis & Optimization**

>My GSoC project involved performance analysis and optimization for these implementations.



# Description

The primary goals were the following:

1. Performance analysis using various metrics (i.e. strong/weak scaling, thread utilization charts) and profiling tools.
This includes:
- Writing many small benchmarks for different algorithms / implementations.
- Automate building & running them while changing a whole lot of different parameters (size of data to proccess, CPU cores, grain size).
- Create useful visulizations for collected data.

2. Observe collected data to find bottlenecks and improve existing implementations.
